Dear Hiring Team,

I'm excited about the Software Engineer, ML Tools role at awesomesauce. Your focus on practical ML systems resonates with my work on the fashion app, where I built a 3D outfit planner using React and Next.js. It helped users visualize outfits instead of scrolling photos—a small but meaningful step toward personalized experiences.

The mission to build products people actually use aligns with how I approach engineering. My fashion app explored personalization through embeddings search and cosine evaluation, skills directly relevant to ML tools development. I've built backend services with Python and Java that handle validation, logging, and metrics—key for reliable ML pipelines.

I'd start by pairing on a scoped backend fix with tests, then add observability to one workflow. My experience shipping RAG chatbots and embedding pipelines ensures I can contribute quickly while learning your systems.

Thank you for considering my application. I'd love to discuss how my focus on practical tools can support your team's goals.
