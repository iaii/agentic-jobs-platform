Dear Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the Software Engineer - Early Career role at General Motors. My fashion app, a personal 3D outfit planner built with React and Next.js, shows how visual tools improve user engagement. I’d love to bring this experience to your team.

Your role focuses on backend development, APIs, and testing. For my fitness app, I built clean backend endpoints with validation and logging. I also wrote unit tests for critical flows to ensure reliability.

The Slack bot I developed handles command parsing and API integrations with error retries and logging. I plan to pair during onboarding to ship a scoped backend fix with tests. Then I’ll add observability to one key flow.

I’m eager to contribute to General Motors’ mission and learn from your engineering culture. Thank you for considering my application.
