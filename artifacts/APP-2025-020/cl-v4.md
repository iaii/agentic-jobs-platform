Hi Hiring Team,

I am excited about the Software Engineer - Early Career role at Unknown Company. My fashion app shows how visual tools can boost user engagement. I want to bring that experience to your team.

In my fitness app I built clean backend endpoints with validation, logging, and unit tests. I also developed a Slack bot that parses commands, integrates external APIs, and retries on failure. These projects demonstrate my backend, API, and testing skills.

I plan to pair during onboarding, ship a scoped backend fix with tests, and add observability to one flow. I am eager to contribute to Unknown Company’s mission of building products people actually use.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
