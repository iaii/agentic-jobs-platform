Dear Hiring Team,

I was excited to see the Software Engineer - Early Career role at Unknown Company. My fashion app project—a personal 3D outfit planner built with React and Next.js—aligns with your focus on creating products people actually use. I’ve seen how visual tools transform user engagement, and I’d love to bring that perspective to your team.

Your role emphasizes backend development, APIs, and testing—areas where I’ve built production-ready systems. For my fitness app, I connected health APIs to clean backend endpoints with validation and logging. I also wrote unit tests for critical flows, ensuring reliability without overcomplicating scope.

The Slack bot I developed demonstrates my ability to ship focused solutions. It handles command parsing, API integrations, and error retries while maintaining observability through logging and metrics. I’d approach onboarding by pairing closely to ship a scoped backend fix with tests, then add observability to one key flow.

I’m eager to contribute to Unknown Company’s mission and learn from your engineering culture. Thank you for considering my application.
