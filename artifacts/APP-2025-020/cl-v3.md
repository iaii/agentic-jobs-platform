Dear Hiring Team,

I am excited about the Software Engineer - Early Career role at General Motors. My fashion app, a personal 3D outfit planner built with React and Next.js, shows how visual tools can boost user engagement. I want to bring that experience to your team.

I have strong backend development skills. In my fitness app I built clean API endpoints with validation and logging. I also wrote unit tests for critical flows. My Slack bot demonstrates my ability to ship focused solutions. It parses commands, integrates external APIs, and retries on failure. I log events and expose metrics.

I value a learning environment. I plan to pair during onboarding to ship a scoped backend fix with tests. Then I will add observability to one key flow. I am eager to contribute to General Motors’ mission and grow with your engineering culture.

Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
