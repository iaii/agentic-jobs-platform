Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer, AI Inference Codesign role at Unknown Company. The mission to build products people actually use resonates with my work on the My fashion app, where I stitched 3D assets into a React flow so users can visualize outfits instead of scrolling.

Impact highlights
- Evaluation → safer releases: replaced subjective RAG reviews with a cosine‑similarity harness so every change ships with metrics.
- Anomaly detection → clearer signals: summarized ~3M Z‑Wave events and proposed an HMM‑inspired monitoring that caught silent failures.
- Reporting → faster diagnosis: standardized JSON‑powered Power BI templates so leadership dashboards stayed fresh without manual toil.

First 60-90 days
- Ramp by pairing with a mentor, reading design docs, and taking scoped tickets to learn the stack.
- Ship a small API or UI improvement with tests plus logging so others can build on it.
- Add observability to one path, write a short runbook, and support one data/UX question end‑to‑end.

Stack
Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript/React, REST APIs. I write tests, add logs, and document changes so teammates can operate the system confidently.

I am eager to bring my experience in backend APIs, testing, and AI inference to Unknown Company’s culture of building real‑world products. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
