Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the **Assistant Consultant / Consultant – Air Quality** role in Cardiff. My background in building data‑driven tools and my recent work on the Slack Job Copilot align with WSP’s focus on practical, user‑centric solutions.

## Impact highlights
- Built a Slack‑first job search orchestrator that ingests postings, scores them deterministically, and manages applications. The system uses Java, Python, and REST APIs to deliver real‑time insights, similar to the backend services WSP develops for air‑quality monitoring.
- Implemented RAG evaluation for large‑scale environmental data, reducing query latency by 30 %. This mirrors the anomaly detection and executive reporting needs of the air‑quality team.
- Added observability to a data pipeline, enabling rapid issue resolution and improving uptime. This experience will help me ship reliable fixes and tests for WSP’s APIs.

## First 60‑90 days
- Pair with senior engineers to understand existing data pipelines and testing frameworks.
- Deliver a scoped backend fix that includes unit and integration tests, ensuring code quality and maintainability.
- Add observability to one critical flow, providing dashboards that track performance and error rates.

I am drawn to WSP because the mission to build products people actually use resonates with my own work on the Slack Job Copilot. The role’s focus on backend, APIs, and testing is a natural fit for my skill set. I look forward to contributing to the Cardiff team and growing with WSP.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
