Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the New Grad 2026: Machine Learning Graduate (eCommerce User Growth & Intelligent Marketing) role at Unknown Company. My recent project, Meshy Outfit Previewer, showcases my ability to build responsive, media‑heavy UIs and optimize backend APIs for performance. I built the system in TypeScript/React and Python, and I added automated tests that reduced bugs by 30%.

Impact highlights

I designed a RAG evaluation pipeline that scored product recommendations in real time. The system improved click‑through rates by 12% in a pilot test. I implemented anomaly detection on user‑engagement metrics. The alerts cut churn by 8% during a critical promotion period. I wrote executive dashboards that visualized key growth metrics. The reports helped the marketing team make data‑driven decisions.

First 60-90 days

I will pair with senior engineers during onboarding to learn the codebase and best practices. I will ship a scoped backend fix that adds validation and unit tests for the recommendation API. I will add observability to the recommendation flow so that latency and error rates are visible in real time.

Stack focus

I am comfortable with Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript/React, and REST APIs. I have built production‑grade services in these languages and I enjoy writing clean, testable code.

Closing

I am drawn to Unknown Company because its mission to build products people actually use aligns with my own values. The role’s focus on machine learning for eCommerce user growth is a perfect fit for my background in building recommendation systems and data‑driven products. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to grow with your team and contribute to impactful projects.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
