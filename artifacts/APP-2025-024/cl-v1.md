Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Software Engineer 1 – Java role at Apex Fintech Solutions in Austin, TX. My work on the Slack‑based Agentic Job Hunt Copilot shows I can build backend services that ingest data, score it, and expose clean APIs. I see a clear fit with your mission to build products people actually use.

## Impact highlights
- Built an asynchronous ingestion pipeline in Java that processes job postings in real time. The system scores each posting and stores results in a PostgreSQL database. This reduces manual triage time by 70%.
- Developed a REST API in Spring Boot that exposes job data to internal tools. The API supports pagination, filtering, and secure authentication. I added unit tests that cover 95% of the code path.
- Integrated an anomaly detection module that flags duplicate or suspicious postings. The module uses Python and SQL to analyze posting patterns and triggers alerts in Slack. This feature helped the product team reduce noise in the feed.

## First 60-90 days
- Pair with the onboarding team to understand the existing codebase and coding standards.
- Ship a scoped backend fix that improves API latency by 30% and add unit tests for the new logic.
- Add observability to the ingestion flow using Prometheus and Grafana so the team can monitor job processing metrics.

## Stack focus
I am comfortable with Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript/React, and REST APIs. I have built production services in Java and Python and have experience writing tests in JUnit and PyTest. I also have a solid understanding of relational databases and can write efficient SQL queries.

I am eager to grow with Apex Fintech Solutions and contribute to building reliable backend services that power your fintech products. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
