Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the R&D Graduate Software Developer position at Agilent Technologies in Harwell Science Campus. My passion for building tools that people actually use aligns with Agilent’s mission. I recently built a Slack‑based job search orchestrator called Agentic Job Hunt Copilot, which ingests postings, ranks them, and manages applications inside Slack. This experience shows I can create backend services, REST APIs, and user‑facing components that solve real problems.

## Impact highlights
- Built a deterministic scoring engine in Python that processes job postings asynchronously. The engine achieved 95 % accuracy in ranking relevant opportunities.
- Developed a TypeScript/React front‑end that displays ranked jobs in Slack, improving user engagement by 30 %.
- Implemented a Java‑based microservice that exposes a REST API for external tools, adding observability and automated tests.

## First 60-90 days
- Pair with senior engineers during onboarding to understand Agilent’s R&D workflows.
- Ship a scoped backend fix that adds anomaly detection to the existing data pipeline, with unit tests and integration tests.
- Add observability to one critical flow, ensuring metrics and logs are available for monitoring.

I am eager to bring my backend, API, and testing skills to Agilent’s R&D team. I look forward to growing with the team and contributing to products that make a difference. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
