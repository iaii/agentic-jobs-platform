Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Backend Software Engineer, AI Document Generation role at Unknown Company. My fashion app lets users visualize outfits in 3D. I love building products that help people in everyday life.

Impact highlights
- Evaluation → safer releases: I replaced subjective RAG reviews with a cosine similarity harness so every change ships with metrics.
- Anomaly detection → clearer signals: I summarized 3M Z-Wave events and proposed an HMM inspired approach that caught silent failures.
- Reporting → faster diagnosis: I built JSON powered Power BI templates that automated recurring workflows and reduced manual reporting time.

First 60-90 days
- Ramp by pairing with my mentor, reading design docs, and taking scoped tickets to learn the stack.
- Ship a small API or UI improvement with tests and logging so others can build on it.
- Add observability to one path, write a short runbook, and support one data/UX question end to end.

Stack and habits
I work with Java, Python, SQL, TypeScript, and REST APIs. I write tests, logs, and short runbooks. I collaborate through clear documentation and frequent communication.

I am eager to contribute to Unknown Company’s mission of building products people actually use. I thrive in learning environments and am excited to grow with your team. Thank you for considering my application.

Best regards,
Apoorva Chilukuri
