  goal: >
    Use this YAML as context to write cover letters that add new information beyond my resume.
    Do not restate my resume line by line. Instead, explain how my experiences map to the specific role,
    what kind of engineer I am, and why I care about the product and problem space.
  use_resume_like:
    - "Ground truth for dates, titles, and basic responsibilities."
    - "Source of hard facts, but not something to quote directly."
  avoid_in_cover_letter:
    - "Copying resume bullets or listing every tech stack used."
    - "Recounting my internships exactly as written in the resume."
    - "Reading like a formatted resume paragraph."

profile:
  bio: "Recent computer science graduate who likes building reliable backend and data heavy systems that real people actually use."
  identity_notes:
    - "I am early career, but I care about craft and about how users experience what I build."
    - "I am comfortable in messy, real world data and I like making things more observable and predictable."
  what_cover_letter_should_add:
    - "Why this particular company and product resonate with me."
    - "How I think about debugging, reliability, and user impact."
    - "How I like to work with other engineers, PMs, and non technical partners."
    - "What I want to learn on this team and how my existing habits will help."

    - "Productivity and workflow tools, especially things that live where people already work like Slack."
    - "Consumer experiences tied to fashion and discovery."
    - "Fitness and wellness products that help people change behavior."
  domain_mapping_examples:
    - "If the company is in search, knowledge, ads, or any high read system, lean on my RAG evaluation work and data quality mindset."
    - "If the company is in productivity, workflows, or internal tools, lean on my Slack based job copilot and reporting work."
    - "If the company is in health or fitness, lean on my fitness companion project and my genuine personal interest in training and nutrition."
    - "If the company is in mapping, robotics, or hardware linked systems, lean on my anomaly detection work on physical device signals."

work_style:
  how_i_work_day_to_day:
    - "I break work into small, reviewable pieces and ask clarifying questions early."
    - "I instrument what I build, so future debugging is faster and less guessy."
    - "I like to write short, practical notes or runbooks that explain how to use or operate a system."
    - "I am polite but direct in code review and I appreciate clear feedback in return."
  what_i_tend_to_do_without_being_told:
    - "Add basic request validation and error handling around new endpoints."
    - "Log enough context so production issues can be traced later."
    - "Check how a change will affect other teams or users, not just my own API or view."
    - "Clean up small papercuts I see in documentation or scripts while I am there."

    description: >
      Use this section to understand what kinds of problems I have actually tackled,
      so you can argue convincingly that I can grow into similar systems even if the company stack differs.

experience_highlights_beyond_resume:
  jci_rag_eval:
    role_context: "RAG evaluation and chunking experiments for a customer facing chatbot at Johnson Controls."
    how_i_thought_about_it:

    what_i_actually_did:
      - "Defined a small but representative gold set of questions and expected answer snippets."
      - "Computed embeddings and cosine similarity scores so we could see how close answers stayed to the ground truth after a change."
      - "Experimented with different chunking strategies and recorded how they affected both relevance and hallucination risk."

      - "Anywhere there is an AI or search feature that people currently judge by feel, I can help move us toward measurable evaluation."
      - "I bring a habit of treating quality as a pipeline problem, not just a model problem."

  jci_anomaly_detection:
    role_context: "Anomaly detection exploration on roughly three million minute level events from Z Wave devices."
    how_i_thought_about_it:

      - "I tried to understand which anomalies truly mattered for customers versus which were just noisy but harmless."
    what_i_actually_did:
      - "Engineered basic features around time, frequency, and event patterns that could feed into models or rules."

  jci_reporting:
    role_context: "Data quality and reporting for home device data and leadership dashboards."
    how_i_thought_about_it:

      - "I treated this as both a data modeling problem and a communication problem."
    what_i_actually_did:
      - "Tracked down inconsistencies in device payloads and reporting logic rather than just patching symptoms."

      - "Implemented a Slack experience where I get a digest of roles, can save interesting ones, and have application records created automatically."
      - "Used an LLM only for parsing and ranking hints, while keeping the core pipeline deterministic and debuggable."
      - "Instrumented the workflow with logging and basic error handling so when a source fails, I can tell why."
    how_this_maps_to_other_roles:

    how_i_thought_about_it:
      - "I wanted the app to feel playful and smooth, not like a bare bones demo."
      - "I paid attention to how animation and transitions affect how people perceive quality."
    what_i_actually_did:
      - "Built multiple screens that send text to an external sentiment API, interpret the response, and suggest tailored activities."
      - "Added custom animations and transitions to make the experience feel cohesive."
